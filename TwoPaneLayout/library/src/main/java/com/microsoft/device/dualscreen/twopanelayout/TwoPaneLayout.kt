/**
 * A layout component that places its children in one or two panes vertically or horizontally to
 * support the layout on foldable or dual-screen form factors. One-pane can be used to layout on
 * the single-screen device, or single-screen mode on the foldable or dual-screen devices. Two-pane
 * can be used to layout left/right or top/bottom screens on the foldable or dual-screen devices.
 * The tablet or wide screen devices will display two-pane layout by default.
 *
 * The [TwoPaneLayout] layout is able to assign children widths or heights according to their weights
 * provided using the [TwoPaneScope.weight] modifier. If all the children have not provided a weight,
 * they will be layout equally, with the potential padding in-between based on the
 * physical hinge between two screens.
