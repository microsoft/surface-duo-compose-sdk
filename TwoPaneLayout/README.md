# TwoPaneLayout - Surface Duo Compose SDK

**TwoPaneLayout** is a Jetpack Compose component that helps you create UI for dual-screen, foldable, and large-screen devices. TwoPaneLayout provides a two-pane layout for use at the top level of a UI. The component will place two panes side-by-side when the app is spanned on dual-screen, foldable and large-screen devices, otherwise only one pane will be shown. These panes can be horizontal or vertical, depending on the orientation of the device and the selected `paneMode`. [TwoPaneLayoutNav](#twopanelayoutnav) is a new version of TwoPaneLayout that can be used for complex navigation scenarios, and it follows the same pane logic as the original TwoPaneLayout.

When the app is spanned across a separating vertical hinge or fold, or when the width is larger than height of the screen on a large-screen device, pane 1 will be placed on the left, while pane 2 will be on the right. If the device rotates, the app is spanned across a separating horizontal hinge or fold, or the width is smaller than the height of screen on large-screen device, pane 1 will be placed on the top and pane 2 will be on the bottom.

## Add to your project

1. Make sure you have `mavenCentral()` repository in your top level **build.gradle** file:

    ```gradle
    allprojects {
        repositories {
            google()
            mavenCentral()
         }
    }
    ```

2. Add dependencies to the module-level **build.gradle** file (current version may be different from what's shown here).

    ```gradle
    implementation "com.microsoft.device.dualscreen:twopanelayout:1.0.1-alpha05"
    ```

3. Also ensure the compileSdkVersion is set to API 33 and the targetSdkVersion is set to API 32 or newer in the module-level **build.gradle** file.

    ```gradle
    android { 
        compileSdkVersion 33
        
        defaultConfig { 
            targetSdkVersion 32
        } 
        ... 
    }
    ```

4. Build layout with **TwoPaneLayout** or **TwoPaneLayoutNav**. Please refer to the [TwoPaneLayout sample](https://github.com/microsoft/surface-duo-compose-sdk/tree/main/TwoPaneLayout/sample) and [TwoPaneLayoutNav sample](https://github.com/microsoft/surface-duo-compose-sdk/tree/main/TwoPaneLayout/nav_sample) for more details.

## API reference

The sections below describe how to use and customize TwoPaneLayout for different scenarios. Please refer to the [TwoPaneLayout documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/dual-screen/android/jetpack/compose/two-pane-layout) for more details.

To learn more about common use cases for two-pane layouts, please check out the [dual-screen user interface patterns](https://docs.microsoft.com/dual-screen/introduction#dual-screen-app-patterns).

### TwoPaneLayout

The main TwoPaneLayout constructors both accept parameters for a modifier, [pane mode](#pane-mode), and content to show in pane 1 and pane 2. The second constructor also accepts a `NavHostController` parameter, which is useful for accessing navigation information in your app.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun TwoPaneLayout(
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    paneMode: TwoPaneMode = TwoPaneMode.TwoPane,
    pane1: @Composable TwoPaneScope.() -> Unit,
    pane2: @Composable TwoPaneScope.() -> Unit
)

@Composable
fun TwoPaneLayout(
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    paneMode: TwoPaneMode = TwoPaneMode.TwoPane,
    navController: NavHostController,
    pane1: @Composable TwoPaneScope.() -> Unit,
    pane2: @Composable TwoPaneScope.() -> Unit
)
```

The content shown in each pane can access methods from the `TwoPaneScope` interface:

```kotlin
interface TwoPaneScope {

    fun Modifier.weight(weight: Float): Modifier

    fun navigateToPane1()

    fun navigateToPane2()

    val currentSinglePaneDestination: String

    val isSinglePane: Boolean
}
```

The [weight modifier](#weight-modifier) is described in more detail below.

When writing UI tests for composables that use `TwoPaneScope`, you can use the `TwoPaneScopeTest` class. It provides empty implementations of `TwoPaneScope` methods, and you can set the values of `currentSinglePaneDestination` and `isSinglePane` in the class constructor before running your tests.

```kotlin
class TwoPaneScopeTest(
    currentSinglePaneDestination: String = "",
    isSinglePane: Boolean = true
) : TwoPaneScope
```

### Pane mode

The pane mode affects when two panes are shown for TwoPaneLayout. By default, whenever there is a **separating fold** or a **large window**, two panes will be shown, but you can choose to show only one pane in these cases by changing the pane mode.

A **separating fold** means there's a [FoldingFeature](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/window/layout/FoldingFeature) present that returns true for the [isSeparating](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/window/layout/FoldingFeature#isSeparating()) property.

A **large window** is one with a width [WindowSizeClass](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/large-screens/support-different-screen-sizes#window_size_classes) of `EXPANDED` and a height size classs of at least `MEDIUM`.

```kotlin
enum class TwoPaneMode {
    TwoPane,
    HorizontalSingle,
    VerticalSingle,
    SinglePane
}
```

There are four pane modes available for TwoPaneLayout:

- `TwoPane` - default mode, always shows two panes when there is a **separating fold** or **large window**, regardless of the orientation
- `HorizontalSingle` - shows one big pane when there is a **horizontal separating fold** or a **portrait large window** (combines top/bottom panes)

    <img src="screenshots/single-horizontal.png" width=500 alt="HorizontalSingle pane mode on a dual-screen device">

- `VerticalSingle` - shows one big pane when there is a **vertical separating fold** or a **landscape large window** (combines left/right panes)

    <img src="screenshots/single-vertical.png" width=500 alt="VerticalSingle pane mode on a foldable device">

- `SinglePane` - always shows one pane, regardless of window features and orientation

This table explains when one 游릴 or two 游릱游릱 panes will be shown for different pane modes and device configurations:

| Pane mode | Small window without separating fold | Portrait large window / horizontal separating fold | Landscape large window / vertical separating fold |
|---|---|---|---|
| `TwoPane` | 游릴 | 游릱游릱 | 游릱游릱 |
| `HorizontalSingle` | 游릴 | 游릴 | 游릱游릱 |
| `VerticalSingle` | 游릴 | 游릱游릱 | 游릴 |
| `SinglePane` | 游릴 | 游릴 | 游릴 |

### Weight modifier

TwoPaneLayout is able to assign children widths or heights according to their weights provided using the `TwoPaneScope.weight` and `TwoPaneNavScope.weight` modifiers. This only affects the layout for large screen and foldable devices, but for single-screen devices, there will still only be one pane visible, regardless of the weight.

```kotlin
fun Modifier.weight(weight: Float): Modifier
```

For large screens:

- No weight &rarr; two panes displayed equally
- Weight &rarr; layout split up proportionally according to the weight

    <img src="screenshots/tablet.png" width=650 alt="TwoPaneLayout on a tablet/large screen device, weight modifiers of 0.3 and 0.7 provided so panes are divided in a 3:7 ratio">

For foldables:

- Separating fold &rarr; layout split up according to fold boundaries (with or without weight)

    <img src="screenshots/surfaceduo.png" width=500 alt="TwoPaneLayout on a dual-screen device (Surface Duo), no weight modifier provided so panes are divided by fold">
    <img src="screenshots/foldable.png" width=500 alt="TwoPaneLayout on a foldable device, no weight modifier provided so panes are divided by fold">

- Non-separating fold &rarr; device treated as a large screen or single-screen depending on its size

## TwoPaneLayoutNav

The TwoPaneLayoutNav constructor can be used for more complicated navigation scenarios. It accepts parameters for a modifier, [pane mode](#pane-mode), `NavHostController`, navigation graph, and start destinations.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun TwoPaneLayoutNav(
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    navController: NavHostController,
    paneMode: TwoPaneMode = TwoPaneMode.TwoPane,
    singlePaneStartDestination: String,
    pane1StartDestination: String,
    pane2StartDestination: String,
    builder: NavGraphBuilder.() -> Unit
)
```

The content shown in each destination can access methods from the `TwoPaneNavScope` interface:

```kotlin
interface TwoPaneNavScope {

    fun Modifier.weight(weight: Float): Modifier

    fun NavHostController.navigateTo(
        route: String,
        launchScreen: Screen,
        builder: NavOptionsBuilder.() -> Unit = { }
    )

    fun NavHostController.navigateUpTo(route: String?): Boolean

    val currentSinglePaneDestination: String

    val currentPane1Destination: String

    val currentPane2Destination: String

    val isSinglePane: Boolean
}
```

The `navigateTo` method is an enhanced version of the `navigate` method from `NavHostController` that works when one or two panes are shown. The `launchScreen` parameter determines which pane, or screen, a destination should be shown in when in two pane mode: `Screen.Pane1` or `Screen.Pane2`.

```kotlin
sealed class Screen(val route: String) {

    object Pane1 : Screen("pane1")

    object Pane2 : Screen("pane2")
}
```

The `navigateUpTo` method is an enhanced version of the `navigateUp` method from `NavHostController` that also works when one or two panes are shown. If navigation is successful, the function will return true, otherwise it will return false.

> `TwoPaneLayoutNav` manages an internal backstack, so if you want to override the default back press behavior and write a custom handler, make sure you call `navigateUpTo` to maintain the backstack correctly.

When writing UI tests for composables that use `TwoPaneNavScope`, you can use the `TwoPaneScopeNavTest` class. It provides empty implementations of `TwoPaneNavScope` methods, and you can set the values of `currentSinglePaneDestination`, `currentPane1Destination`, `currentPane2Destination`, and `isSinglePane` in the class constructor before running your tests.

```kotlin
class TwoPaneNavScopeTest(
    currentSinglePaneDestination: String = "",
    currentPane1Destination: String = "",
    currentPane2Destination: String = "",
    isSinglePane: Boolean = true
) : TwoPaneNavScope
```

The animation below shows an example of how to use TwoPaneLayoutNav to create custom navigation flows. The layout was created with four app destinations, where destination 1 was passed in as the `singlePaneStartDestination` and `pane1StartDestination` and destination two was passed in as the `pane2StartDestination`. The navigation flow, which works in both single and two pane modes, uses `navigateTo` to go from destination 1-4 in panes 1, 2, 2, and 1 respectively.
