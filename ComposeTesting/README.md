# ComposeTesting - Surface Duo Compose SDK

**ComposeTesting** is a component for Jetpack Compose that helps you easily test your application on the dual-screen, foldable and large screen devices, using the Google [Jetpack WindowManager](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/window) library.

## Add to your project

1. Make sure you have **mavenCentral()** repository in your top level **build.gradle** file:

    ```gradle
    allprojects {
        repositories {
            google()
            mavenCentral()
         }
    }
    ```

2. Add dependencies to the module-level **build.gradle** file (current version may be different from what's shown here).

    ```gradle
    implementation "com.microsoft.device.dualscreen:testing-compose:1.0.0-alpha01"
    ```

3. Also ensure the compileSdkVersion and targetSdkVersion are set to API 31 or newer in the module-level build.gradle file.

    ```gradle
    android { 
        compileSdkVersion 31
        
        defaultConfig { 
            targetSdkVersion 31
        } 
        ... 
    }
    ```

4. Access the info about the window state from **WindowState** to build or adjust your UI. Please refer to the [sample](https://github.com/microsoft/surface-duo-compose-sdk/tree/main/WindowState/sample) for more details.
